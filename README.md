Finding_donors for charity ML:
The goal here is to implement supervised learners on the census data set provided to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield for a fictitious charity organization located in the Silicon Valley. Census data contains records of individuals with additional details like age, workclass, education_level, education_num, marital status and so on. To begin with we start with data exploration, data preprocessing then model evaluation.
